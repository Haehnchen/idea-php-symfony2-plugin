IDEA PHP Symfony2 Plugin
========================

Plugin url: http://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin?pr=&pluginId=7219

--------

__Note__: The plugin has not yet been approved by Jetbrains.

So to test it, you currently need to download the plugin [`.jar` from github](https://github.com/adrienbrault/idea-php-symfony2-plugin/raw/master/symfony2-plugin.jar) and then install it in PHPStorm:
`Settings -> Plugin -> Install plugin from disk`

This plugin also requires that you must have the [latest PHPStorm EAP build](http://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/PhpStorm/PhpStorm+Early+Access+Program).
