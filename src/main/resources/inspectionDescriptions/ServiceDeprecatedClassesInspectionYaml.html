Service or class referenced in YAML configuration is deprecated
<!-- tooltip end -->

<p>
This inspection detects deprecated services and classes used in Symfony YAML service configuration.
It identifies services or classes that have been marked as deprecated and should be replaced
with newer alternatives.
</p>

<p>
The inspection checks for:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Service classes with <code>@deprecated</code> PHPDoc annotation</li>
    <li>Classes marked with <code>#[Deprecated]</code> attribute</li>
    <li>Services explicitly marked as deprecated in Symfony's service definition</li>
</ul>

<p>
Example YAML configuration that would trigger this inspection:
</p>

<pre><code>
# config/services.yaml
services:
    # This will trigger inspection if class is deprecated
    old_service:
        class: App\Legacy\OldService
        # OldService has @deprecated annotation

    # This will trigger inspection if service is deprecated
    deprecated_service:
        class: App\Service\SomeService
        # Service is marked as deprecated in Symfony

    # This will trigger inspection in dependencies
    my_service:
        class: App\Service\MyService
        arguments:
            - "@deprecated_dependency"
            # This dependency is deprecated

    # This will trigger inspection with aliases
    my_alias:
        alias: deprecated_service
        # The target service is deprecated
</code></pre>
